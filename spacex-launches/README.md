# Running and Building the project

Use `npm start` as normal to develop this. And `npm build` to compile it for release.

To run the unit tests use `npx mocha -r ts-node/register src/SpaceXAPI.test.tsx`.

# Libraries used

I used the following libraries:

* material-design for the buttons
* mocha and chai for unit testing.
